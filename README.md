# MBB243 
# Data Analysis for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry

## TL;DR

* This is the course landing page that will host all course materials (instead of Canvas)
* Lecture slides will be posted here after class
* New lab materials will be made available here before each lab
* The structure of the course is summarized below
* Instructions for how to use this repository for your labs are at the [bottom of this page](#Lab-materials-and-server)


## Introduction
The purpose of this introductory data analysis course is to teach students in molecular biology or any students who will analyze molecular data, basic knowledge of molecular biology data types, data analysis methods including basic programming skills using Python, and basic statistics skills using R.

## Location
* **Until further notice, lectures and labs will NOT be held in person**
* Lectures will be held in AQ 4130 (once we resume in-person teaching)
* Labs will be in SSB 6178 (once we resume in-person teaching)

## Grading
* 20% In each lab, there is a list of tasks that should be accomplished in class. Results are submitted by the end of each lab. 
* 35% Lab assignments: For some labs, additional short assignments will be made available in lab sessions and will be due at the start of your lab one week later (unless indicated otherwise). There is a 10% per day late penalty for assignments received after the due date time. 
* 10% In-class midterm exam
* 25% cumulative final exam mixture of multiple choice, short answer and written questions
* 10% Attendance and participation in lecture and lab
