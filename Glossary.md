## annotation

Genomic annotation refers to the process of identifying functional elements in a genome. Annotations are also what we call any set of coordinate-based information that result from this process, in other words, the locations of functional elements and their relationships to other annotations. Examples: gene, a gene's exons, an exon's splice sites, a gene's transcripts, repetitive elements.

### bit

The minimal unit of binary data representation/storage. Can exist in two states (on or off, i.e. 0 or 1).

### byte

A set of eight bits. A minimum amount of information needed to store an ASCII character in a plain text file. 

### character

A data type in some programming languages used to store a single character (printable or whitespace). Examples: `a`, `?`, `\n` (newline).

### string

A common data type used in virtually all programming languages. Used for values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters. A string can contain any sequence of characters, printable or whitespace. Examples: `AAAAA`, `hello world`, `GATTACA`.
